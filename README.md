# BSc Thesis: AI-powered survey system for Android

This repository was created for my thesis. Thesis topic: development of an AI-enabled questionnaire system for Android.

- I developed an Android mobile application with FireBase backend, using MLKit and OpenAI API, with MVVM architecture
- Users can create, edit, and send surveys to each other, as well as fill them out
- Unlike conventional survey systems, this application allows surveys to be created by scanning them using the camera, and questionnaires can be completed using voice control, powered by GPT-3.5 in the background

Nowadays, online surveys and poll systems are very popular amongst users, as they provide an easy way to gather feedback, opinions and information. However, many questionnaires are not completed because they can often be time-consuming to create through formal editing systems, and the concentration and screen time required to answer them can be a similar obstacle.
The new potential of modern artificial intelligence libraries and the ever-evolving smartphones provide an opportunity to rethink familiar processes and ease the problems mentioned above. The aim of this thesis is to describe the technologies and libraries used, and to present a prototype of a questionnaire system designed and built using these technologies and a different approach. Using text recognition, the application is able to scan surveys using the camera of a mobile phone and allows them to be sent, filled out and returned to different users. Taking advantage of the capabilities provided by natural language processing models, the features introduced by the prototype include the ability to fill out surveys using speech control, so it can be done while engaged in other activities.
I used modern technologies such as Jetpack Compose, OpenAI API calls and ML Kit in my Android application, and I tried to design and build an architecture that fulfilled the requirements.
